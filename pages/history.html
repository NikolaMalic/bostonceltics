				The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete
				in the National Basketball Association as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division.
				Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden,
				which they share with the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are regarded as one of
				the most successful basketball teams in NBA history; the franchise is tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for
				most NBA Championships won with 17 (accounting for 23.6 percent of all NBA championships since the league's
				founding) and currently holds the record for the most recorded wins of any NBA team. The Celtics are
				one of the two franchises still playing in their original city.

				<div class="history4"><p>The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after coach Red Auerbach acquired center Bill Russell,
				who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty, in a draft day trade in 1956. Led by Russell and
				superstar point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a
				talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones,
				Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning
				eight consecutive NBA championships throughout the 1960s. After the retirement of Russell in 1969, the Celtics
				entered a period of rebuilding.
				</p></div>

			<div class="history">
				<div class="history2"><p>The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was heavily highlighted throughout the
				1960s and 1980s. During the two teams' many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and the
				Lakers' star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the
				NBA Finals (including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine.
				Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable
				Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards. Both the nickname "Celtics" and their mascot
				"Lucky the Leprechaun" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original
				Celtics, a marquee team prior to the NBA.

			</div>
				<div class="history4"><p>Led by center Dave Cowens and point guard JoJo White, the Celtics returned to championship caliber, winning
				two NBA titles in 1974 and 1976. The Celtics again returned to dominance in the 1980s. Led by the "Big Three"
				that featured Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won the 1981, 1984, and 1986 championships.
				After winning 16 championships throughout the 20th century, the Celtics, after struggling through the 1990s,
				rose again to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen in what was
				known as the new "Big Three" era. The Celtics returned to the NBA Finals in 2010, only to lose to the Lakers in
				a seven-game series.
				</p>
			</div>
			</div>

			<div class="history">
				<div class="history2"><p>By the start of the 2013 season, none of the "Big Three" were still with the team, which ushered in a new era
				for the team. With the help of newly hired head coach Brad Stevens, the team began rebuilding. In his second
				season, Stevens led the Celtics on a return to the playoffs in 2015. During the following season, the Celtics
				clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference, but were eliminated in the Conference Finals. This prompted
				an aggressive rebuild in 2017, where the team acquired All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. However,
				the pair struggled with injuries throughout the 2017–18 season, and the team was again defeated in the Eastern
				Conference Finals, despite pushing the Cleveland Cavaliers to seven games.
